## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors and Solutions

1. **Failed to measure fs-verity**
    - **Cause**: File system integrity verification failure.
    - **Solution**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that the file system is not corrupted.

2. **id info cannot be read**
    - **Cause**: Failure to read identification information.
    - **Solution**: Check if the graphical elements and views are properly defined and accessible.

3. **Directory not found**
    - **Cause**: The specified directory does not exist.
    - **Solution**: Verify that the directory exists and that the app has the required permissions to access or modify it.

4. **Unable to open files**
    - **Cause**: Missing or inaccessible files.
    - **Solution**: Ensure that all required files are present and that the app has the correct permissions to access them.

5. **Redefining intrinsic methods**
    - **Cause**: Intrinsic methods are being redefined, which can cause issues.
    - **Solution**: Review the code for any redefinitions of intrinsic methods and remove or adjust them as necessary.

### Logs and Debugging

- **LogCat**: Use Android Studio's LogCat to view logs and identify issues. Look for specific error messages and stack traces that can help in debugging.
- **Permissions**: Verify that the app has all the necessary permissions. You can manage app permissions through the device settings or by updating the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
